### Jaxopt

I am proud to be a major contributor of [Jaxopt](https://github.com/google/jaxopt) library, a library of differentiable optimizers written in Jax. I did contributions on Armijo Line Search, Anderson acceleration, and quadratic programming with a Jax re-implementation of OSQP. I also contributed to the documentation and the tests.

### Cartomensia

I was the team leader of a team 17 people for the [Cartomensia](https://graal.ens-lyon.fr/cartomensia/) project: a software to play "[La Batarde](http://www.labatarde.com/)", a card game inspired from "Belote" and few other. The project was written in C++ and SFML. It contains:
- a game engine,
- a GUI,
- a server to play online,
- a bot to play against based on Monte Caarlo Tree Search.
