Since 2020 I am pursuing a PhD degree student in machine learning and deep learning in [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr) laboratory in Toulouse (France), under the supervision of Mathieu Serrurier. I am part of the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institude ([ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr)), and part of the [DEEL](https://www.deel.ai/) team as well.  
  
My CV can be found [here](/assets/pdf/BETHUNE-CV.pdf).  
  
### Short bio  
  
I obtain by baccalaureate in 2014 in small city of the north of France. I moved to Valenciennes in the preparatory classes for the competitive examination to enter the French engineering school. I was received at Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon in 2016 as a civil servant. I obtained my master degree in 2019 in the same school, majoring in [fundamental computer science](http://informatique.ens-lyon.fr/en/academic-programs/master/m2), with a specialization in [complex systems](https://www.ixxi.fr/enseignement).  
   
I did an internship at Google Brain Paris in 2019 under the supervision of Olivier Pietquin and Matthieu Geist. Later on, I did a research internship in ENS Lyon with Pierre Borgnat and Aurelien Garivier. I was under the supervision of Vincent Gripon at Telecom Bretagne in 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I was lucky to go back to Google Brain Paris in 2021 for a research internship under the supervision of Mathieu Blondel, where I made a significant contribution to [jaxopt](https://jaxopt.github.io) library.
